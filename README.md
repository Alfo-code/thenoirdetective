# The Noir Detective

### Description
For my first WordPress project, I took on a unique challenge: building a website for a private detective agency.
I've used Elementor website builder to create a visually dark and informative website with a blog.
Then, I challenged myself by converting it to a static site using Simply Static for improved performance and security.
After converting it to a static site, I encountered issues with the contact form and search bar that wouldn't work without a database.

### Built with
- WordPress
- Elementor
- [Simply Static](https://simplystatic.com/)


### Live URL
